              <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
                <p>I was born in London, England and moved to the East Coast of the United States at the young age of 5.  I grew up in a small town in the Northwest corner of Connecticut.  For my Senior Project in High School, I did an apprenticeship at a glassblowing studio called Bristow Studio Glass.  From the very first moment I gathered hot glass, I knew I wanted to pursue glassblowing. I have dedicated almost my entire adult life to learning the craft of blowing glass.  It is a truly magical material and I am very fortunate to have found my passion at such a young age.  I spent my early twenties traveling and experiencing different cultures and places, until I found the right one.  And moved to Portland, Oregon in 2004 where I buckled down and developed and continue to improve my skills as a glassblower.</p>

              <h3>These are of few things that make me happy...</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>hobbies</li>
                  <li>interests</li>
                  <li>go here</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>I am interested in learning how to code because...</h3>
                <p>I started getting interested in learning to code when I realized the city I love and call home (Portland, Oregon) was beginning to change drastically and very quickly.  Being a crafter/artist, I knew that the city was going to spit me out if I did not learn a skill that pays a living wage.  In an ever changing economy I had to play the games the rest of the world play.  I also think computers, the internet, and programming languages are the wave of the future, and until the apocalypse happens, they will be a driving force in all sectors of society.  There is also a lot of similarities between glass and coding.  They both take a lot of time and effort to learn.  And once you feel you understand, you realize you donâ€™t, which I like, it just makes you want it more.  So in an effort to remain in our fair city and continue to make glass art, I am pursing another skill to add to my bag of tricks. </p>

              <h3>Here are the first projects that I have worked on...</h3>
                <p>These projects were all from class at Epicodus.  Most of them are not complete, and were worked on with partners.  I really like working in the pairs as you can learn so much from each other.</p>
