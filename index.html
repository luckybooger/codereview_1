                    <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
                      <p>I was born in London, England and moved to the East Coast of the United States at the young age of 5.  I grew up in a small town in the Northwest corner of Connecticut.  For my Senior Project in High School, I did an apprenticeship at a glassblowing studio called Bristow Studio Glass.  From the very first moment I gathered hot glass, I knew I wanted to pursue glassblowing. I have dedicated almost my entire adult life to learning the craft of blowing glass.  It is a truly magical material and I am very fortunate to have found my passion at such a young age.  I spent my early twenties traveling and experiencing different cultures and places, until I found the right one.  And moved to Portland, Oregon in 2004 where I buckled down and developed and continue to improve my skills as a glassblower.</p>

                    <h3>These are of few things that make me happy...</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Riding my bike</li>
                        <li>Snorkeling</li>
                        <li>Fishing</li>
                        <li>Hiking</li>
                        <li>Dancing</li>
                        <li>Camping</li>
                        <li>Traveling</li>
                        <li>Learning</li>
                        <li>Eating</li>
                      </ul>

                    <h3>I am interested in learning how to code because...</h3>
                      <p>I started getting interested in learning to code when I realized the city I love and call home (Portland, Oregon) was beginning to change drastically and very quickly.  Being a crafter/artist, I knew that the city was going to spit me out if I did not learn a skill that pays a living wage.  In an ever changing economy I had to play the games the rest of the world play.  I also think computers, the internet, and programming languages are the wave of the future, and until the apocalypse happens, they will be a driving force in all sectors of society.  There is also a lot of similarities between glass and coding.  They both take a lot of time and effort to learn.  And once you feel you understand, you realize you donâ€™t, which I like, it just makes you want it more.  So in an effort to remain in our fair city and continue to make glass art, I am pursing another skill to add to my bag of tricks. </p>

                    <h3>Here are the first projects that I have worked on...</h3>
                      <p>Most of these projects are not complete, and all were worked on with partners, except for Goodbye.  This list is in chronological order of projects that can be accessed on my git hub.  The first project was done in a one day work shop with Code Fellows, where I gained my first interest in learning how to code.</p>
