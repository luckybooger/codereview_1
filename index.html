                    <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
                      <p>I was born in London, England and moved to the East Coast of the United States at the young age of 5.  I grew up in a small town in the Northwest corner of Connecticut.  For my Senior Project in High School, I did an apprenticeship at a glassblowing studio called <em>Bristow Studio Glass</em>.  From the very first moment I gathered hot glass, I knew I wanted to pursue glassblowing. I have dedicated almost my entire adult life to learning the craft of blowing glass.  It is a truly magical material and I am very fortunate to have found my passion at such a young age.  I spent my early twenties traveling and experiencing different cultures and places, until I found the right one.  And moved to Portland, Oregon in <strong>2004</strong> where I buckled down to develope and continue to improve my skills as a glassblower.</p>

                    <h3 class=happy>These are of few things that make me <strong>happy</strong>...</h3>

                    <h3 class=happy>I am interested in learning how to code because...</h3>
                      <p>I started getting interested in learning to code when I realized the city I love and call home (Portland, Oregon) was beginning to change drastically and very quickly.  Being a crafter/artist, I knew that the city was going to spit me out if I did not learn a skill that pays a living wage.  In an ever changing economy I realize I have to play the games the rest of the world play.  I also think <span class="important"> computers</span>, the <span class="important"> internet</span>, and <span class="important"> programming languages</span> are the wave of the future, and until the apocalypse happens, they will be a driving force in all sectors of society.  There is also a lot of similarities between glass and coding.  They both take a lot of time and effort to learn.  And once you feel you understand, you realize you do not, which I like, it just makes you want it more.  So in an effort to remain in our fair city and continue to make glass art, I am pursing another skill to add to my bag of tricks. </p>

                    <h3 class=happy>Here are the <strong>first</strong> projects that I have worked on...</h3>
                      <p>Most of these projects are <span class="important"> not complete</span>, and all were worked on with partners, except for Goodbye.  This list is in chronological order of projects that can be accessed on my git hub.</p>
